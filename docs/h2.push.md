With HTTP/2 becoming more common place, one of the first features of the new version is *Server Push*. Which allows web servers to send required assets for the current page (or known following pages) to the client as part of the first request.

When a client connects a website using HTTP/2 a connection is opened which downloads the web page (as it would normally in HTTP/1 as well). But the connection can also be used to "Push" resources down with the initial request, meaning the entire web page (including required resources) can be downloaded on a single connection in parallel.

This saves users (especially those on mobile) the horror of connection latency to open up another connection to download the required resources.

It is recommended to "push" (at a minimum) any block scripts or stylesheets in the head of your page. This enabled users to download a full working version of your page to render while the rest of the page downloads. Giving your users a faster experience as the page would load extremely fast.

# How do I fix this ?

To enable *Server Push* there are a few options:

* Using a provider like [CloudFlare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-support-for-http-2-server-push-2/) that support the (Draft) Stardard of `preload` from [W3C](https://w3c.github.io/preload/#server-push-http-2) will enable Server Push by simply providing a extra header. See the [#preload](Preload) for more details on how to enable in your website.
* If using a language like NodeJS that creates the entire web service, server push can be implemented using one of the newer libraries, see [Current HTTP/2 Implementations](https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations) for details for your language/framework of choice.
* For those with complete control over their servers, popular Web servers like NGINX will be getting support to enable soon.

# Preload

The preload header allows websites to configure server push using only headers, to enable or disable respectively for resources. See the details from [W3C](https://w3c.github.io/preload/#server-push-http-2)

To enable for a resource, the following header should be provided:

```
Link: </asset/to/push.js>; rel=preload; as=script
```

To disable for a specific resource:

```
Link: </dont/want/to/push/this.css>; rel=preload; as=stylesheet; nopush
```

## NGINX

To configure headers for NGINX include the following in your server block:

```
server {
  ...
  add_header Link "</dont/want/to/push/this.css>; rel=preload; as=stylesheet; nopush"; 
  ...
}
```

## Apache (Most shared hosts)

To configure headers for Apache add the following to your `.htaccess` file (in the root of your website) with the following:

```
Header add Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=157680000"
```
