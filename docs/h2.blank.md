HTTP/2 is a important step forward for HTTP. The new version of the protocol focused on retaining backward compatability while increasing performance. Thanks to providers like [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) and support from most of the big browsers like Chrome / Safari / IE / Opera ([Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/#feat=http2)), HTTP/2 has become wide spread and a large section of the internet is using it already.

The response returned when using the HTTP2 client was blank, which could indicate a badly configured server or unintended logic by the application when using the new protocol.

# How do I fix this ?

Ensure that the HTTP/2 config is correct and that no unexpected behaviour occurs when clients try to connect to the page over HTTP/2
