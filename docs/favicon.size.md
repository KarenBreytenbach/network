Great news the site has a favicon but it is a tad too big. 

Favicons should be kept as small as possible making it cacheable and usable by the older browsers.

Newer browsers allow extra icons to be set either in the [manifest.json](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) file or meta tags that can define icons for numerous screens sizes.

# How do I fix this ?

Make sure the favicon at the root of your website (`/favicon`) small (< 10kb).
