HTTP/2 is a important step forward for HTTP. The new version of the protocol focused on retaining backward compatability while increasing performance. Thanks to providers like [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) and support from most of the big browsers like Chrome / Safari / IE / Opera ([Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/#feat=http2)), HTTP/2 has become wide spread and a large section of the internet is using it already.

With the large usage in mind, HTTP/2 can start improving performance immediately. This does not mean that website owners/developers should start dropping support for HTTP/1.1 but rather hit a balance between the 2 protocols. While HTTP/2 is the next version of HTTP, HTTP/1 will still be around for a long time.

The new version does change commonly regarded best practices of web development from HTTP/1.1, such as:

* Domain Sharding is no longer recommended as all files can be downloaded faster over the single connection to your server and *at the same time*.
* Inline Assets to save performance is no longer a big concern.
* Concatenating files could actually diminish performance.

Numerous demo's have been posted online showcasing the speed:

* [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/http2/)
* [Akamai](https://http2.akamai.com/demo)
* [GoLang](http://http2.golang.org/gophertiles?latency=0)

# How do I fix this ?

HTTP/2 support can be achieved in a few ways, depending on your hosting setup:

* Put your website behind a service like [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare) which will enable the new protocol without having to touch servers of any kind. Great option for websites making use of Shared Hosting.
* Upgrade to a newer version of your web server, most web servers like [NGINX](http://nginx.org/) now support HTTP/2 out of the box
